President Donald Trump will not meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un next month, he announced in a letter to Kim released by the
White House Thursday morning, scrapping plans for what would have been a historic diplomatic summit.
He said during an appearance from the Roosevelt Room the decision amounted to a "tremendous setback" and warned North Korea that
the US military is ready to act should Pyongyang take any "foolish and reckless" action.
"Our military, which is by far the most powerful anywhere in the world that has been greatly enhanced recently as we all know, is ready
as necessary," he said.
But he left open the door to renewing the diplomatic thaw which had preceded the anticipated talks.
"If and when Kim Jong Un chooses to engage in constructive dialogue and actions, I am waiting," he said.
In his letter, which the administration said was dispatched through established communication channels to North Korea, Trump wrote
with chagrin the summit was off.
